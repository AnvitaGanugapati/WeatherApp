Weather app in CSS, HTML, and JS following a tutorial

# Overview
This is a weather app that grabs weather data from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to display the real-time weather in the inputted city. I built this project following a step-by-step youtibe tutorial, while actively engaging in learning about the tools and technologies involved.
